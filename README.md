# ValidatorAccumulator

I built two separate projects, Simple and ValAcc.  Simple was just Merkle Tree work, and ValAcc integrated
a database (Badger) and did some benchmarking of what kind of transaction rates might be possible under
this approach.

## Simple

This code base was used to measure just the overhead of creating merkle trees by adding elements one at
a time.  The goal was originally to spread out the overhead of creating merkle trees over time, so there
would not be a huge cpu demand at the end of a block.

Turns out the algorithm is very simple and flexible.  There is no database integration in this code, just exploring 
what can be done with Merkle Trees.

## ValAcc

The Validator/Accumulator (ValAcc) architecture allows for multiple applications to use the same facility
to collect and order data.  These applications can happily run along side each other, or interact
with each other.

Cryptographic proofs for sets of data can be exported outside the ValAcc, and used by outside processes
without access to all the data held within the ValAcc itself.

Use cases include digital identities, IoT security, Supply Chain, Digital Rights Management, Document Management,
Loan Origination, Tokenization, Smart Contracts, and pretty much anything else that can be done on a blockchain.

The ValAcc is intended to be run on top of the Factom Protocol, and used to extend the use cases that can be
built on the Factom Protocol.

The ValAcc can be run from the commandline to do various tests on performance on various architectures.
```
Usage of ValAcc:
  -a int
    	the number of accumulator instances used in this test (default 1)
  -c int
    	The number of chains updated while processing this test (default 1000)
  -e int
    	the number of entries to be processed in this test (default 1000000)
  -t int
    	the tps limit of data generated to run this test. if t < 0, no limit (default -1)
```

So running at the commandline:
```
     ValAcc -a 8 -e 30000000 -c 10000 -t -1
```     
yields on my machine: 
```
=========================
 -e <number of entries>
 -c <number of chains>
 -t <tps limit ( -1 is none)>
 -a <number of accumulators>
=========================
Entry limit of          30,000,000
Chain limit of             100,000
TPS limit of                  none
# of Accumulators                8
